This repository contains Python code for conducting two different experiments related to random number generation:

Experiment 1: Generating random numbers according to specified distributions and calculating their averages and variances.
Experiment 2: Implementing the Inverse Transform Method and Rejection Method for generating random numbers from a given probability density function.

Experiment 1
Description
This experiment involves generating random numbers X based on the formula X = A + B * C, where A, B, and C are randomly generated integers or binary values. We then calculate the averages and variances of A, B, C, and X.

Experiment 2
Part a: Inverse Transform Method
Description
This part implements the Inverse Transform Method for generating random numbers from a uniform distribution.

Part b: Rejection Method
Description
This part implements the Rejection Method for generating random numbers from a given probability density function.
